# bitmap-generator

> This tool comes in handy for creating duotone bitmaps, especially as a basis for screen print designs. You can directly print your dithered bitmap to inkjet film and start preparing your silk-screen.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
